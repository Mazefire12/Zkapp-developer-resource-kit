Community built zkApps
Mina Secret Exchange - The secret exchange allows users to buy imaginary tokens after successfully providing the solution to a series of math problems while keeping the solution itself secure and private, not exposing it to the network.
Blind Man's Bluff - A simplified version of poker where zk-SNARKs keep the contract unaware of the actual numbers users have, yet giving it the knowledge of the game result.
Snapp Hangman - With Mina's SnarkyJS API and SnarkyJS library showing their zero-knowledge capabilities, this is a zkApp Hangman game utilizing zk-SNARKs to keep the secret word and random input private.
